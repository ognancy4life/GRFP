This repository contains a jupyter notebook and link to launch a binder to analyze the 2021 GRFP Awardee list. To launch the binder, click here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ognancy4life/GRFP

Once you are inside the binder, press play to step through the code or just browse the results (I have posted the notebook with output.)
