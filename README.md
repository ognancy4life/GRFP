This repository contains a jupyter notebook and link to launch a binder 
to analyze the 2021 GRFP Awardee list. To launch the binder, click here:

Once you are inside the binder, press play to step through the code or 
just browse the results (I have posted the notebook with output.)

Congratulations to those who received awards! And to those who did not, 
know that this will not stop you from achieving your dreams!
